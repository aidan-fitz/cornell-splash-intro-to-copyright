  \framesubtitle{England, 1476-1709}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Printing press arrived in England in 1476
    \item King Richard III valued literary works
    \item But after that, England moved to censor books, especially books
    promoting Lutheranism
    \item Eventually granted the Stationers' Company a monopoly on printing
    from 1556 to 1695
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Unpopular because it failed to protect authors and gave the
      government considerable power to censor works
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \textit{An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of
  Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times
  therein mentioned.}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Replaced the printing monopoly and censorship system
    \item The author of a book had the exclusive right to print it for 14-28 years
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Registration and multiple deposits at the Stationers' Company were
      required for copyright protection
%      \item Publishers often ignored the deposit requirement because it was
%      too expensive for print runs of 250 or so copies
    \end{itemize}
    \item Act also banned foreign works except Greek and Latin classics
    \item Writers such as Jonathan Swift and Daniel Defoe touted copyright as a
    novel mechanism for incentivizing authors to share their knowledge

  \frametitle{Copyright Comes to America}
  \framesubtitle{United States, 1783-1790}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The American economy was largely agrarian, so copyright was not a
    priority
    \item Initially established by states
    \item James Madison and Charles Pinckney proposed the copyright and patent
    clause in the Constitution
    \item Jefferson supported the freedom to share and remix, so he proposed
    adding limits on copyright and patent terms to the Bill of Rights
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions
      in literature and their own inventions in the arts for a term not exceeding
      -- years but for no longer term and no other purpose.}
      \item But this provision was not added
    \end{itemize}
    \item The majority of works published between 1790 and 1799 were not
    registered for copyright protection
  \end{itemize}

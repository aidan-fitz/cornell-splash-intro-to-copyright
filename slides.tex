  \frametitle{About Me}

  I'm a freshman at the College of Engineering.
  My intended major is Computer Science, and I'm passionate about open source
  and social justice. Naturally, I have my own views on copyright, but I'm going
  to stick to the facts as much as possible.

  Also: I'm from New York City.
